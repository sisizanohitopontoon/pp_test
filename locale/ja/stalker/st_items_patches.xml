    <text>Clear Sky faction patch</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_clearsky_fp_descr">
    <text>This faction insignia depicts a sunrise against a clean blue sky, flanked by doves. It is meant to communicate the faction's desire to heal the Zone as well as its distaste for conflict. Among those who have encountered the likes of Novikov or Kalancha, it is widely believed that Clear Sky wishes to gradually reduce the frequency and severity of blowouts and other anomalous cataclysms.\n \n

  <string id="st_freedom_fp_descr">
    <text>This faction insignia depicts a green wolf set against a black background alongside the Ukrainian flag. Overall, the design is meant to communicate Freedom's social nature and love of the land alongside their staunch determination and collective predatory viciousness in battle. Why anarchists would want any country's flag as part of their design, however, is a mystery.\n \n

    <text>Commonly worn by unaligned stalkers, this patch is considered a common collectible by Mercenaries, who trade the patches in to a mysterious buyer. As Loners are numerous, yet often split and alone, they're considered easy pickings by the more organized and predatory groups in the Zone. \n \n

  <string id="st_ecolog_fp_descr">
    <text>This faction insignia depicts a pair of golden wings set against a white and cyan background. These patches are highly valued on the Zone's black market, as sewing one convincingly into a suit can allow a stalker to go almost anywhere without fear of molestation by other groups. Ecologists almost never part with their patches willingly, however, although that doesn't stop the Zone's less scrupulous denizens.\n \n

    <text>This faction insignia depicts a cracked black skull set against a white shield. This symbol is highly in keeping with the vision held by some of the faction's leaders - that they are no mere thugs, but instead the lords of their own feudal mobs, bringing order to those who accept their "protection" and visiting ruthless retribution upon anyone who dares defy them.\n \n

    <text>This faction insignia depicts a gold crosshair set against a red and black shield. Overall, the design is meant to allude to the faction's Military roots, but without detracting from their chief role as the stoic, bloody-handed soldiers who must constantly battle against the Zone for the sake of the world outside.\n \n

  </string>
  <string id="st_monolith_fp_descr">
    <text>This insignia depicts a set of wings in profile against a golden sun - possibly a symbol for the legendary Wish Granter. The most intriguing aspect of this patch is that it belongs to people who are believed to be brainwashed, and isn't found anywhere else. Thus the existence of the patch means that either Monolith troops retain a higher level of creativity than initially thought...or they're being secretly supplied by an unknown outside force. These patches are highly valued among other groups, as they're a good way to prove that one is able to regularly fight against Monolith and live - an ability highly respected by the veterans of the Zone.\n \n

    <text>This faction insignia is a full military coat of arms. It depicts three shields, the centermost one in the colours of the Ukrainian flag with two swords in saltire behind it. Surrounding the shields are golden laurels. Evidently, the Military forces in the Zone fancy themselves as protectors and peacekeepers first and foremost. Whether they actually fulfill this role is a matter of bitter contention.\n \n

Sewn onto the back of the patch - and away from casual observation - is a label saying the insignia belongs to the "United Nations International Scientific Group".\n \n

    <text>Simply holding this patch makes you feel a little uneasy. In the top left corner is a serpent, while in the right there's an Eastern Orthodox Cross. A stylized depiction of an eclipsed star is set against the very center of the patch. As you continue to hold it, however, the unease subsides, slowly giving way to a strange sense of peace.\n \n

That this item exists would imply the Renegades once had a greater goal at some point in their existence, although no one today would believe they stay together out of anything but sheer desperation. The item is still kept in circulation among Renegades, possibly out of nostalgia.\n \n
