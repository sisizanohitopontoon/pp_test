    <text>Damn right it is! Welcome to the Train Hangar, now repurposed by yours truly into a safe little bar and hunting lodge...well, for the most part.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="hunter_trader_meet_2">
    <text>And what happens at this bar of yours?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="hunter_trader_meet_3">
    <text>Eh, simply put, this place is for hunters. Whether they're professional or amateur doesn't matter. I reward those who take on hunting jobs for me, I pay well for any mutant trophies you might turn in, and I'll sell you food and hunting equipment real cheap - unlike some other traders around here, the desire to share my passion with others comes first. Never cared much for money grubbers anyways.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="hunter_trader_meet_4">
    <text>Are there any other hunters around here, or just you?</text>
  </string>
  <string id="hunter_trader_meet_5">
    <text>Eh, I had a few mates here with me. We were all hunting partners in the outside world, you know? Gonta, Trapper, Fox...all good people. We all got together down here to have a proper funeral for Fox, but sadly the other two couldn't stay - by the sounds of it, the stalkers up north really need them.</text>

  <string id="hunter_trader_meet_6">
    <text>Maybe I'll go pay them a visit sometime.</text>

    <text>You know what I think? I think Duty's high command are secretly paying them to sit there - sort of like lookouts to spy on the goings-on between Rostok and Dark Valley. In any case, those traders don't really have the hunting spirit - for them, it's all "hoard, hoard, hoard"! So really, it's just as well those magpies haven't moved in.</text>

    <text>ミュータントについて何か教えてくれないか？</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_1">
    <text>There are a few cute rodents in the Zone, called "tushkanos". You've seen them for sure. They don't really appear dangerous, but in packs, they can easily kill even an experienced stalker. There was a case where a special squad of Dutyers went to sweep a bloodsucker lair. Those idiots made camp somewhere in the middle of the Agroprom complex... One of the guys took off somewhere while another screwed around on his PDA. No one was keeping the night watch. Morning came, and no one was there - something was wrong.\n \nThe first people to enter that room were in for a big surprise... The throats of the squad members had been all chewed up. Typical tushkano traces. God knows why the rodents just up and left their meal. Anyway, the rest of the soldiers decided to head to the lair and finish the job, writing off the deaths of their comrades afterwards.\n \nThat's how those men perished. Some stalker ended up retrieving their PDAs, having a new story to tell in the Bar for shits and giggles.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_2">
    <text>Every rookie encounters a few dogs at the Cordon, as well as in the Great Land. They don't really differ that much from their "prototypes", so to speak - except they're blind, but that doesn't really keep them down, since their other senses have evolved... especially their ability to smell. They can take out newbies like fish in a barrel, and sometimes more experienced stalkers, too, mostly thanks to their maneuverability and sudden strikes. Hey, here's a story for you... Somebody made it a habit to snatch some sausage from the Bar.\n \nEveryone raised some fuss, tore up the security, and some men from Duty even ended up keeping watch and check who was stealing. Eventually, they saw a dog run in through a hole in the fence and, naturally, shot it down. In the morning, a solemn-looking stalker comes into the Bar and asks about the dog...\n \nBarman realizes what's happening and tells him to ask the guys from Duty. Turns out the fresh-faced lad was moving to the Zone with that dead dog, who was his pet. They went though a lot... The guy was also an orphan, and then this happens to him. Ever since that moment, any wise guy who crosses the border into the Zone with a pet either keeps moving or makes dinner out of his "little friend" for other stalkers... just to keep tensions low. By the way, all that sausage was actually stolen by a local alcoholic.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_3">
    <text>There are dogs, and there are pseudodogs. Why "pseudo", you ask? Well, they originally evolved from wild wolves. On their own, they are easily dispatched by point blank buckshot rounds, much like ordinary wild dogs. However, a pack of pseudodogs is nothing to scoff at. Moreover, they conjure clones of themselves that swarm you... and when that happens, you need to find and kill the real one for the phantoms to stop appearing, otherwise you end up wasting precious ammo and risk getting yourself badly hurt.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_4">
    <text>Let me tell you about snorks. The most common theory is that they are former military personnel who guarded the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant before the second explosion, when it completely fried their brains and turned them into abominations. Something like a zombie, only... even more bestial and primitive. They crawl on all fours, claw, kick, and even pounce fairly long distances to close in on their prey. Just one is dangerous, but a group of them? Might as well off yourself right then and there.\n \nIf you ever come across snorks, sidestep their pounce, then blast their ass full of lead. Heck, if you're confident, but also have a death wish, you can kill them in midair. Good luck with that.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_5">
    <text>Zombies. You know those cheap American movies where zombies just grunt, moan, and attack with their hands? Well, it ain't like that in Zone... sort of. Most zombies here are former stalkers, their brains completely mashed, torn, and battered by the Brain Scorcher. A lot of them still retain their speech, and are also capable of operating firearms. Nobody understands what they say... although, a friend of mine recently came to visit after a long expedition in Jupiter, and he was attacked by zombies.\n \nThe paleness of his face said it all... Said they were begging for help, that they were tired, hungry. Who knows. Poor bastard. Sakharov can give you a better understanding. There's also a more barbaric, generic type of zombie, like the ones you see in movies.\n \nThey're slow, and not at all capable of using guns, so it should be simple to kill them... Just don't let them corner you. They are also masters of feigning. Shoot them anywhere other than the head, they'll fall over and wait for your closure. You get your knife out, then stab the fuckers right in the skull. If you're skilled enough, you can even have at them them while they're moving.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_6">
    <text>Bloodsuckers? Let's see. Rumor has it they're mutated human beings. Whether or not they mutated from the radiation after the explosions or were scientifically modified by other humans, I don't know. What I do know, however, is that they're one of the most dangerous predators inhabiting the Zone. Not only do they boast incredible speed, but they also camouflage themselves, making them extremely dangerous and aggressive beasts. They use stealth and circle around you, tiring your legs out, waiting for the perfect moment to strike - and when they do, you lose consciousness.\n \nSee, their name speaks for itself. They drain so much blood that by the time you unhinge those slimy feelers off your neck, you might as well be a piece of paper floating in the wind.\n \nI've heard stories of a stalker having committed suicide while being circled indefinitely by a bloodsucker. It's almost like a game to them, really. When they're not sucking your blood through a straw, their razor sharp claws come into play. Just like snorks, you can avoid their attacks, but you gotta expect it - be alert, use a shotgun, aim for the head, then fire. Rookies end up with empty mags and unique wounds. You'd better find a high spot or stick close to an object, so that you don't creak up behind and look at both of them, because suddenly this bastard will appear before you, but squeeze and shoot the weapon more tightly. That's the best tactic if they find you alone. Running away from them is problematic.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_7">
    <text>Burers. They are near-legendary creatures, the existence of which many don't even want to know... Personally, I shit myself with fear just thinking about them. The best advice I can give regarding burers is not to go in dungeons and any kinds of empty complexes, laboratories in particular, because they love dwelling in such places. Recently, though, they have been sighted in pretty much every place in the Zone, and this is primarily thanks to to the actions of the Marked One, who turned off the Brain Scorcher.\n \nChimeras too, for example, used to live closer to the center of the Zone, but then suddenly migrated and increased their population. Apparently, someone who runs all of this in the center of the Zone has got some influence over these creatures, and uses them as a kind of Cerberus on the last approaches towards their "stronghold".\n \nIf you get into trouble and end up unable to escape, I'd advise you to protect your head, because they've got relatively powerful telekinesis powers. They can also send a focused impulse and knock you off your feet, as well as take away your weapons and exhaust you, somehow influencing the gravity around you. They resemble fat, hideous dwarfs, who wear huge shoes with their own characteristic sounds, as well as black cloaks, strangely enough sewn almost their size. I too think that they are the result of experiments in secret laboratories. There are also different subspecies of burers - for example, fire and electric, just like poltergeists. Some argue that the poltergeist is an evolutionary stage of the burer... however, if an electric poltergeist acts on you only with telekinesis, then a corresponding burer can easily throw a ball of lightning at you or even a whole Electra anomaly, the size of a substation.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_8">
    <text>Controllers are no joke: those monsters emit a steady psy-background, and they can manipulate the consciousness of any person. It's absolutely fatal to approach them without the right type of protection, and you're generally better off staying away from any places they might be dwelling in. They'll most likely just burn your brain out - not even zombifying you - in order to make some juicy grub out of you right then and there. Legend's going around saying that they can even talk, but I don't really believe it... Their high level of intellect is beyond doubt, though.\n \nSometimes they can stage clever ambushes. They often wander alone, greedy for food, or thinking about whatever goes on in that screwed-up head of theirs... A stalker once dropped by and told me and the boys that there was a weird creature that settled down around Rostok.\n \nHe went to have a look, but was stopped by a sudden, severe headache that almost made him drop his gun. So, he backed off, thinking it was just radiation... The rest of us went with him to scoop the place out, came in – and I also felt a headache! Later we went back prepared, having taken some special pills that basically killed any emotions we had... I looked around and saw a man-shaped figure sitting in the darkness. I opened fire, but it disappeared - and then, the bastard came out behind my back, and I shot him. Then I heard a faint, yet familiar voice... and couldn't believe it. I shot down my friend Vasyuk. Eventually we managed to get rid of that mutant freak, but I quit hunting ever since and ended up opening a bar here. I was fortunate not to get killed... Redhead was a smart guy, so he took off to the north after what happened.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_9">
    <text>And the cats... Have you seen those things? Oh, god. Only this place can turn pets into feral beasts. Their whole thyroid gland is swollen from all the radiation, along with tumors in their cheeks. I don't know why those cats have become like this. These creatures have become bigger with sharper claws, and they run like crazy. People usually have to get domestic cats down from trees... Here, you're the one who gets chased around. To make matters worse, they've developed a pack mentality, similar to dogs and wolves.\n \nThese creatures are wild and they can be found anywhere, so keep an eye on your surroundings at all times. They come running, and if you aren't careful, they will cling onto your ass and bite a chunk off it.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_10">
    <text>Not many people here believe in the paranormal, and everyone has their own faith. Some people believe in their own strength, some believe in their leaders and some believe in alien intervention... and only a few in God. Anyways, there is still a monster by the name of "poltergeist", because how else would you describe a translucent flying shit that throws objects at you? Still, there's pretty much nothing in common between the mutant and the type of entity in folklore. You can kill it in quite ordinary ways, it doesn't react to salt - we had a poor bastard that tried it - and looks like a flying electric anomaly, or less commonly, a fire essence.\n \nThe electric one, like a burer, loves showering you with all sorts of random garbage, but the fire one is able to somehow create a jet of fire right in front of your fucking face - similar in effect to a geyser, and extremely hot.\n \nShoot directly into the essence - you won't miss, but it is very difficult to kill because of its speed and maneuverability. In a few cases, stalkers have spotted some kind of black or smoky poltergeist. Nothing certain is known about its properties, but it's quite a rare specimen, and probably because meeting with it means death in the overwhelming majority of cases. It is even more difficult to kill because the smoke is much less localized, and thus aiming and shooting at its core is harder.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_11">
    <text>There are also creatures whose tales are told in front of campfires. They are called Fractures. Humanoid creatures with hypertrophic arms and necks, they possess an abnormal hand that can break a person's chest, while the other is more often than not normal, without any anomalous property. There are a lot of stories about the fact that Fractures often like to come into contact with stalkers and ask for all kinds of crap, from cans to imported toothpaste.\n \nIf you aren't lucky and you don't have what it asks of you, then prepare for battle or certain death... especially death, because Fractures often come into contact during a favorable situation for them; for example, if you are alone and he's already holding you from behind with his bucketed hand. If you have what he asks of you, then don't rush and hand it over; then move away from it quietly and on all fours, it won't harm you.\n \nWell, it's all stories, who knows. Some even leave provisions in places where Fractures have been seen, in vain hopes to drive them off.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_12">
    <text>Here's another one: the pseudogiant. Usually, only exceptional specimens stand much taller than a human... however, its powerful paws can cause very strong shock waves, which is how it earned its name. Until recently, again, nothing about it was known, and it is most likely another of those abominations from the laboratories, thanks to the underground assholes who love to rummage around every single complex and not close any doors behind them. To the north, there was some kind of military guy who never shut the door at some facility... at the Iron Forest in Zaton, I believe.\n \nSince then, these giants have been observed even in the vicinity of the Jupiter plant. By looking at some of its features, it is possible to determine that "it" was once a man... like the small, hanging arms in front of the main ones, its skin, and a few other characteristics.\n \nIt's got some sharp teeth, but don't worry about that - it's more likely to just knock you down and crush you. And don't take its awkward appearance into account, because it never falls down and never goes astray. The best thing to do before going near an area where a pseudogiant has been spotted is to grab a couple of rifle grenades and a machine gun, as the skin and bones of the mutant show excellent resistance to small arms, and the creature itself is very resilient.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_13">
    <text>The chimera can rightfully be considered at the top of the food chain in the Zone. How come? It is a very clever creature - a nocturnal predator that can pounce at you with a single jump from a distance of several tens of meters. Four-legged mutant, has two heads, for which it has received its nickname. It is also very durable and has sharp claws, capable of tearing through even the skin of a pseudogiant. It lets out a characteristic roar while jumping, frighteningly similar to a person's. They've have mainly been encountered in the northern parts of the Zone, in open places near facilities or complexes.\n \nAs told by local hunter Trapper, they have their own sphere of influence, where they rest and hunt during late at night. There is also a subspecies, namely the black chimera. It has skin like pitch, and cannot be seen at all in the dark, which makes it much more dangerous than its less camouflaged relatives.\n \nIt is also said to be stronger and more enduring. Escaping from a chimera is impossible - it's better to find a narrow room that will reduce its ability to maneuver, or try to jump aside while it leaps at you.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_14">
    <text>Wild boars and flesh. The latter are an example of a terribly mutated pig, as proven by scientists - rather sluggish and weak... Only a complete moron could get under its "bladed" paws, which will penetrate virtually any armor. As for boars, differ little from their relatives outside the Zone, apart from the fact that they are larger and more dangerous... Oh, and their hooves are much stronger, and can cut through fabric and human flesh effortlessly. It's enough just to jump aside and move somewhere in a couple of meters when these beasts rush at you, to avoid their fangs.\n \nOftentimes, the meat of both wild boars and flesh is consumed, but not without being treated beforehand, to avoid radiation poisoning.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_hunter_gar_trader_life_15">
    <text>Karliks... here's what I've jotted down. They mainly reside in underground complexes, most of which have previously been used for experiments on people. Apparently, Karliks are the result of such experiments. They share remarkably similar properties with Burers, but rather than using telekinesis, they focus on running up to you and attacking you with their very hands. They've also got a pretty potent psy-field, so no matter how hard they try to get close, it'd be a bad idea to keep them close.\n \nOverall, you don't need to worry about them too much, they're not that dangerous, just don't slow yourself down by laughing hysterically. Yes, it's happened before...</text>
