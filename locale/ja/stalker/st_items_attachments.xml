    <text>このスーツのユニークなところは、周囲の電気エネルギーを吸収して部分的に体に変換し、耐久性を高める装置だ。過剰なエネルギーは損傷した組織の再生につながる。主に衝撃電流に対する過電圧保護として機能し、本体に接触する電気量を制限します。貴重な無線コンポーネントで構成された複雑な電子回路を表し、ボディの電気抵抗が大幅に増加します。その結果、人体はより低い電圧にさらされ、以前は死に至った電気の放電に耐えることができるようになります。したがって、電気の異常または他の電源に近づく必要がある場合には、電流制限マイクロリアクターを有することが極めて重要である。他のスーツと同様に、修復材料としても使用できます。\n \n \n

  <string id="st_hide_burer_descr">
    <text>Skinning a burer is a lot like skinning a twisted dwarf. Add to it an almost unbearable stench of bad eggs and you get the idea why stalkers consider this quite a feat. Reports indicate that whereas the skin offers relatively low physical protection it can be used to absorb and disperse significant amounts of incoming psy waves when worn over the head. Burer's skin has low electrical resistance, thus the wearer is more susceptible to electrical damage. Furthermore, due to the fact that burers are relatively rarely encountered in the Zone, the skin has significant research potential, making it a valuable trading commodity for the scientists.\n \n

  <string id="st_hide_chimera_descr">
    <text>Chimera, being one of the most dangerous mutants in the Zone, is not only a significant threat, but can also be regarded as a viable source of wealth. All parts that can be taken from chimera's corpse can be sold for a large amount of money, but it is the skin that is one of the most valued scientific specimens as well as one of the best armour enhancements available in the Exclusion Zone. It offers very good protection properties and, even more importantly, is relatively light-weight thanks to which it does not limit mobility. However, its most unique feature is that organic fibres found in the skin act as very effective electrical conductors. This fact to a large degree confirms reports of recon units (especially those scouting around the AMK Industrial Complex) concerning sightings of chimeras surrounded in what looked like an electrical anomaly, producing discharges on contact with any hostile living organism. Unfortunately, no unit was able to make it back, so there is no evidence confirming the existence of such a creature.\n \n

  <string id="st_hide_pseudogiant_descr">
    <text>The skin of a pseudogiant in many ways resembles the skin of an elephant. It's thick and hard in touch, its texture is very irregular and full of folds which act as the creature's cooling mechanism. The average thickness of pseudogiant's skin is around 2 cm, which makes it very durable and capable of withstanding significant damage. This is, however, at the cost of increased weight. Since pseudogiants are known to often live in areas of high toxicity and radioactivity, the hide naturally adapted to such conditions, which further increases its usefulness. It can also be used to patch even the heaviest of outfits but this process requires the most durable and expensive tools available. It is valued not only for its practical qualities, but can also serve as a prestigious hunting trophy and a rare specimen for the scientists in the Zone.\n \n

  <string id="st_hide_controller_descr">
    <text>As is the case with other humanoid mutants, it's quite an emotional challenge to scalp a controller and it proves to be even more difficult as the face of a controller retains certain characteristics of the person it once was. Confidential sources within the military also revealed that fingerprints of the person who turned into a controller can sometimes be found in the database. Recent analysis shows that not only the hand of the controller is capable of producing psy waves - the whole body is the source of emissions. For this reason, the scalp - when prepared properly - has the ability to absorb and filter psy energy, but for this effect to take place it is necessary to cover your head with multiple scalps. The skin is also electrically conductive. As regards its physical properties, it is light and can only be used for minor outfit repairs. As is the case with all humanoid psy creatures, the skin of a controller is electrically conductive.\n \n

    <text>Densely covered with short and stiff fur, the pelt of pseudodog remains one of the most useful, widespread and versatile mutant pelts available in the Zone. It can be easily attached to armour with even lightest of tools, and yet it's quite durable, which makes it suitable for medium-grade outfit repairs. When used as a whole - it can cover significant area of the body with protective layer which increases resistance to both physical damage and heat. The fur also provides effective insulation. However, as is the case with all such pelts, it easily catches radioactive and toxic particles, so it is highly advised to remove it when in radioactive or toxic areas.\n \n

    <text>The fur of a psy dog is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and rare clothing materials in the world. Usually snow white or grey, it is in great demand and can be sold for a hefty sum of money. It's probably made its way into fashion industry thanks to smugglers some of whom have recently turned to hunting mutants. For those in the Zone, it can serve as a blanket, especially during cold nights, and offers efficient rupture protection and mild psy influence reduction when head part of the fur is used as a mask or a hood. However, it easily catches radioactive and toxic particles, so it is highly advised to remove it when in radioactive or toxic areas. Hunters wear it with pride, but only if the creature was slain by their own hands.\n \n

Practical use is limited but some stalkers are known to sprinkle their most cherished hunting knives with it as it makes sharpening significantly easier.
