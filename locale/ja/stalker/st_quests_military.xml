  <string id="barrier_defense_zombie_intro_2">
    <text>Very well, usually they dont put up much of a fight but we are short on manpower thanks to Monolith and those pretend soldiers, it should be as easy as shooting at the range.</text>

    <text>Very well, hope you didn't recognize anyone in there. Sometimes people come back from the Barrier more shaken up than when fighting Monolith. Let's have a drink at those poor souls, and something to help you not end up like them.</text>
